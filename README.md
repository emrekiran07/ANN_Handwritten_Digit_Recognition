# ANN_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
This is a project that predicts the handwritten digits with using the Artificial Neural Networks. 
The idea is to take a large number of handwritten digits, known as training examples, and then develop a system which can learn from those training examples. In other words, the neural network uses the examples to automatically infer rules for recognizing handwritten digits.
The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. .
Four files are available:
